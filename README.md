## Introduction
The increasing research in the field of deep learning has led to the development of many state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures for audio processing tasks. However, the implementation of these architectures is often not straightforward and requires a lot of effort. There has not been many attempts to provide a comprehensive guide to building an end-to-end industry grade deep learning model training pipeline for audio processing tasks. This repository aims to fill this gap by providing a practitioner's guide to building an end-to-end industry grade deep learning model training pipeline for audio processing tasks. The repository also hosts deep neural network architectures trained for audio processing tasks. These include wav2vec, ASR, etc.
